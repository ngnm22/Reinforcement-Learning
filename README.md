# Reinforcement Learning
This project trains a bipedal robot to learn to walk using Truncated Quantile Critic as our baseline model. This was decided based
on research comparison of other state-of-the-art algorithms that have attempted to solve the same environment. We proceeded to enhance this
algorithm by integrating Adaptively Calibrated Critic on top of AdaTQC to overcome overestimation bias. We found that the end result
overtook our baseline algorithm and solved both easy and hard environments.
